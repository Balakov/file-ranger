# file-ranger
A dual-pane file explorer for Windows.

Inspiration from Xplorer2 which I used for many years before it became too bloaty for my liking. 

Supports all common file operations using standard Windows file dialog operations. 
Recycle bin support.
Drag & drop files and directories to toolbar and drive view to create shortcuts.
